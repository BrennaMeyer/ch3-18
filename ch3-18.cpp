//Interest Earned
//Assuming there are no deposits other than the original investment, the balance in a savings account after one year may be calculated as
//Amount = Principal × (1 + RateT)T
//Write a program that asks for the principal, the interest rate, and the number of times the interest is compounded.It should display a report similar to :

//Interest Rate : 4.25 %
//Times Compounded : 12
//Principal : $ 1000.00
//Interest : $   43.34
//Amount in Savings : $ 1043.34
